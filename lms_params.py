"""
Prediction-parameter helpers for EA_LMStudio.

Pure functions that turn widget strings into the shapes the LM Studio SDK
expects. Kept out of ``LMStudio.py`` (which imports the lmstudio SDK and ComfyUI
and performs a network fetch at import time) so they stay unit-testable on their
own.

Everything here is validated against ``LlmPredictionConfigDict`` from the
``lmstudio`` Python SDK. That type is the authoritative list of accepted keys —
and the SDK *silently discards* keys it does not recognise rather than raising,
so a typo or a wished-for parameter becomes a no-op that looks like it worked.
``LMStudio.py`` guards against that by diffing the requested config against the
config the server echoes back on every run.
