Reasoning / thinking extraction for EA_LMStudio.

Pure text-processing helpers with no heavy dependencies (only ``re`` and
``typing``). Kept in a standalone module — separate from ``LMStudio.py``, which
imports the lmstudio SDK and ComfyUI and starts a background model fetch at
import time — so this logic stays importable and unit-testable on its own.
